# Configs

## Property Precedence

Properties that are more specific, deeper in the configuration, take precedence over those that are higher.

```
{
  content : 'Hello',
  children : [
    {
      content : 'World'
    }
  ]
}
```

In this case, `content`'s value is 'World'.

## Special Properties

Some properties are reserved for the workflow manager.

### Task

Determines which task to render.

### Tasks

Sometimes having multiple tasks might be useful. These are not additive:

```
{
  tasks : ['InformationScreen', 'DisplayText'],
  children : [
    {
      tasks : ['ConsentLetter']
    }
  ]
}
```

The tasks will only be ConsentLetter as the property gets overwritten.

### Children

The children property contains the next set of tasks for the workflow to go through. In this example, order shows what order the config would be parsed in.

```
{
  children : [
    {
      order : 1
    },
    {
      order : 2
    },
    {
      children: [
        {
          order : 3
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      order : 4
    }
  ]
}
```

## Scoping

Configs can sometimes get messy or two tasks might use the same property. They can be scoped by using the task name:

```
{
  task: 'InformatioScreen',
  Hello : {
    content : 'hello world'
  },
  withContinue: true
}

```
