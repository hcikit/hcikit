## Install

```bash
npm install --save cefn
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

import Experiment from "cefn";

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return <MyComponent />;
  }
}
```

## Development

To install the development version, clone the package from github.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blainelewis1/cefn
cd cefn
npm install
npm run build
```

Then install the package from your local package to test. The package must be built.

```bash
cd my-project
npm install --save ../cefn
```

If you're creating a new task then make sure you have the framework running with npm start to ensure it constantly gets compiled. There is also a working example in the example folder.
